# CS421_PA2
Client-server VendingMachine simulator

This is a solution for Bilkent CS 421 Programming Assignement #2 of 2016 Spring Semester.
The assignment specifications are in the accompanied PDF file.
To run the program, first compile using terminal:

$javac VendingMachine.java

Then run a server:

$java Vending <available port number your choice>

Then run a client on a seperate terminal screen:

$java Vending [IP address of the server. localhost if both client and server are on the same machine] [the same server port number from previous step]

You can run (hopefully when tis done) multiple clients simultaneously on the server.

Enjoy!
